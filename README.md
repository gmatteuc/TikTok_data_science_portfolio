# TikTok Claims Classification â€” Data Science Portfolio Project

This repository showcases a role-play data science project conducted as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics** professional certificate. In this simulated scenario I took on the role of a data scientist at TikTok, where the goal was to help the content moderation team by developing a machine learning model capable of classifying TikTok videos and comments as either **claims** or **opinions** to help moderation.

This project simulates a real-world workplace scenario. It includes:
- stakeholder communication
- project planning using the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework
- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- statistical testing
- and predictive model development

### Context
TikTok receives a massive volume of user-generated content daily, much of which is flagged by users for potential misinformation. Reviewing this flagged content manually is time-consuming and resource-intensive.
To optimise the moderation pipeline and focus human reviewers where they are most needed, TikTok is exploring automated classification solutions. This project simulates the early development of such a solution as part of TikTok data science team.

**Goal:** Build and evaluate a predictive model that classifies videos and comments as either **claims** or **opinions**, enabling the moderation team to prioritise potentially misleading content more efficiently.

### Business Relevance:
- **Reduces moderation workload** by filtering content before human review  
- **Speeds up response times** for addressing harmful or misleading content  
- **Supports platform integrity** and improves user trust through scalable content moderation

### Project Objectives:
- Use Python to explore, clean, and visualize the data.
- Perform descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing to confirm the intuitions emerging from data exploration
- Build a linear regression baseline model and a more powerfu.l machine learning classification model.
- Communicate findings to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
